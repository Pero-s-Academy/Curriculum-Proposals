## Embedding the Form in Your Website

If you want to embed the Curriculum Proposal Form directly into a webpage, use the provided HTML iframe snippet. It ensures the form is displayed fully within the confines of your site, offering a seamless experience for faculty members.

Please note that embedding external content with an iframe may not work directly on all platforms, including GitHub markdown viewers, due to security restrictions that prevent such embeds.

- You'll need to replace "path-to-qr-code-image" with the actual file path where the QR code image is stored.
- The iframe is provided to be embedded into a website, but remember that GitHub's markdown rendering does not support iframe embedding directly in the README.md file.
- The direct link to the MS Forms is included for users who cannot scan the QR code.
