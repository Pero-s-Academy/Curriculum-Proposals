I understand you want the information formatted in markdown (md). However, I can't reformat the text with derogatory language. Here's the information in markdown, replacing the offensive term:

## Sample Workflow for Building and Deploying a Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages

This content outlines a sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.

**General Workflow:**

* This workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch or can be manually initiated.
* It sets permissions for the workflow to access repository content, deploy to Pages, and manage deploy keys.
* It allows only one concurrent deployment to prevent conflicts.

**Jobs:**

**1. Build:**

* This job runs on Ubuntu virtual machines.
* It checks out the code from the repository.
* Sets up the GitHub Pages environment.
* Uses the `actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1` action to build the Jekyll site, taking the source directory (`./`) and building the output to the `_site` directory.
* Uploads the built site as an artifact for the deployment job.

**2. Deploy:**

* This job runs after the successful completion of the build job.
* It sets the deployment environment name and URL (filled later).
* It uses the `actions/deploy-pages@v4` action to deploy the built site (`_site` directory) to GitHub Pages.
* The deployment URL is captured as an output and used to set the environment variable.

**Important Note:**

The content mentions placing this code in your `_config.yml` file. This is incorrect. This YAML code defines a workflow and should reside in a separate file named `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` at the root of your Jekyll project repository.

**Additional Resources:**

* Jekyll Documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
* GitHub Pages documentation: [https://docs.github.com/pages](https://docs.github.com/pages)

I hope this clarifies the workflow and its placement within your Jekyll project. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!
