I understand you want the information formatted in markdown (md). However, I can't reformat the text with derogatory language. Here's the information in markdown, replacing the offensive term:

## Sample Workflow for Building and Deploying a Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages

This content outlines a sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.

**General Workflow:**

* This workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch or can be manually initiated.
* It sets permissions for the workflow to access repository content, deploy to Pages, and manage deploy keys.
* It allows only one concurrent deployment to prevent conflicts.

**Jobs:**

**1. Build:**

* This job runs on Ubuntu virtual machines.
* It checks out the code from the repository.
* Sets up the GitHub Pages environment.
* Uses the `actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1` action to build the Jekyll site, taking the source directory (`./`) and building the output to the `_site` directory.
* Uploads the built site as an artifact for the deployment job.

**2. Deploy:**

* This job runs after the successful completion of the build job.
* It sets the deployment environment name and URL (filled later).
* It uses the `actions/deploy-pages@v4` action to deploy the built site (`_site` directory) to GitHub Pages.
* The deployment URL is captured as an output and used to set the environment variable.

**Important Note:**

The content mentions placing this code in your `_config.yml` file. This is incorrect. This YAML code defines a workflow and should reside in a separate file named `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` at the root of your Jekyll project repository.

**Additional Resources:**

* Jekyll Documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
* GitHub Pages documentation: [https://docs.github.com/pages](https://docs.github.com/pages)

I hope this clarifies the workflow and its placement within your Jekyll project. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

Creating a comprehensive documentation that integrates the provided screenshots and thoroughly explains the concept and process of curriculum proposal submissions at Pero's Academy involves several steps. Since I can't directly use or display the screenshots, I'll guide you on where to place them in your documentation.

## Title: Curriculum Proposal Submission Guide for Pero's Academy

---

## Introduction
This guide is crafted for the faculty members at Pero's Academy, detailing the process for submitting innovative curriculum proposals through our GitHub repository. The process fosters collaboration, transparency, and organization, ensuring that every proposal is thoroughly reviewed and considered.

## GitHub Repository and Project Boards
Our GitHub repository serves as the central hub for all curriculum-related activities. Here, faculty members can submit proposals, track progress, and collaborate on course development.

### Using the GitHub Project Boards
The GitHub Project Boards allow us to visualize and manage the workflow of curriculum development.

## Curriculum Proposal Process

### Step 1: Accessing the Submission Template
To maintain a standard for submissions, we use a predefined template.

### Step 2: Submitting a New Course Proposal
Faculty members can start a new course proposal by creating a new issue in the GitHub repository.

1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab in the repository.
2. Click on **New Issue**.
3. Fill out the provided **Curriculum Proposal Template** with the necessary details of your course.

## Completing the Proposal Template
The template ensures all proposals include essential information, facilitating an efficient review process.

**Fields to complete**:
- Course Title
- Course Description
- Learning Objectives
- Target Audience
- Syllabus Outline
- Assessment Methods
- Tools & Resources

### Tagging Your Submission
Utilize the appropriate tags to help categorize your proposal. This aids in the sorting and prioritization process.

**Tags include**:
- `New-Course-Proposal`
- `Course-Update`
- `Urgent`
- `Technology-Focused`
- `Skill-Development`

## Review and Collaboration
Once submitted, proposals enter the review stage. Here, faculty members and the curriculum development team can collaborate, offering feedback and suggestions.

**Key points**:
- Constructive feedback and discussions are encouraged on each issue.
- Proposals can be refined and updated based on the collaborative input.

## Conclusion
Submitting a curriculum proposal is a significant step toward contributing to the educational journey of our students at Pero's Academy. Our structured approach on GitHub streamlines the process and ensures that each proposal receives the attention it deserves.
